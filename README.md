# PythonLibrary
The local library wants to improve its current system for managing books and patrons. Right now, librarians keep track of books on paper and patrons check out books by writing their name in a logbook. This system is inefficient and error-prone. The library wants a new system that can be easily used by librarians and patrons alike.
We will create a library management system using Python. The system should allow librarians to:
-Add new books to the library's inventory
-Remove books from the inventory
-Check out a book to a patron
-Check in a book that a patron has returned
-Patrons should be able to:
-Check out a book
-Check in a book
Return a book they have checked out
The system should also keep track of overdue books and send notifications to patrons who have overdue books.
